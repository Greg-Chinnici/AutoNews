            "character": "David",
            "line": "The numbers are quite striking, Emily. We're talking billions of square feet of flat, open, sun-exposed space. Studies suggest that covering these roofs with solar panels could generate enough electricity to power millions of homes annually and significantly cut carbon emissions."

            "character": "Emily",
            "line": "Beyond the environmental benefits, there are clear advantages for the businesses themselves, such as reduced electricity bills and increased energy independence. It also helps reduce energy lost during transmission because the power is generated so close to where it's used."
